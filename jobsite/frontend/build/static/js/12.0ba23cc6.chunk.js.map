For claims or disputes where the total\n\t\t\t\t\t\tamount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within\n\t\t\t\t\t\t100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United\n\t\t\t\t\t\tStates, and unless the parties agree otherwise.
